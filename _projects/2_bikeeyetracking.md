In the course spatial simulation we completed several smaller exercises to learn the modelling language GAMA, that led up to a bigger project completed as a group. 
In this project we completed a study that collected sight-data from cyclists, which we used to validate our model. Our model shows how the perception area changes, if the cyclist is stressed, from other traffic participants or crossings.
