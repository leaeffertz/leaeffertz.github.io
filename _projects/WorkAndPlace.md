In the course SDI Services Implementation we created a data infrastructure, with a dashboard as a visualisation. For the Dashbaord, we chose comparing gender-differences in Austria. As there is a stark gender-difference in people working part-time. As the dashboard is targetted to teenage-students in Austria, it is in german.

Find the report below and check out the [dashboard](https://geoportal22s.zgis.at/portal/apps/dashboards/8cd3f1c73fb549a3b489be3bc864d572)!
