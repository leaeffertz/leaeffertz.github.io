As part of my Master’s program in Applied Geoinformatics, I completed a two-and-a-half-month internship at Trafficon, a Salzburg-based company specializing in geospatial technologies for sustainable mobility. During my time there, I gained new technical skills and hands-on project experience and got to know a great team and company culture that values innovation, collaboration, and work–life balance.


## Internship Overview  
My internship lasted eleven weeks (July–September 2024), working full-time with a flexible schedule. I joined a collaborative project exploring the possibilities of a **European data space** that integrates multiple data providers, including weather data and simulated floating car data.  

My main focus was on **aggregating and matching point data to a road-network graph** and creating an application to calculate average emissions for road segments. This involved:  
- Researching best practices for handling traffic emission data  
- Exploring methods and tools for matching point data to network structures  
- Developing a Java program (with PostgreSQL and Kafka) to process the data and calculate average emissions  


## Work Environment and Culture  
The work environment at Trafficon was welcoming and collaborative. Everyone was approachable and supportive, which made it easy to learn and grow. Beyond the technical work, I also enjoyed the team culture, from daily coffee breaks and shared lunches to team events like hiking, bouldering, and even a company trip to Munich.  

These experiences made me feel part of the team and showed me how much the company values both professional growth and personal well-being.  

## Technical Skills Gained  
During the internship, I worked with a range of technologies:  
- **Spring Boot (Java)** for backend development  
- **Apache Kafka** for handling real-time data streams  
- **PostgreSQL** for database management and custom functions  
- **QGIS** for geospatial data handling  
- **GitLab** for version control and collaboration  

I developed an interface connecting Spring and Kafka to receive floating car data, stored it in PostgreSQL, and created functions to match data points to road segments. From there, I implemented emission calculations that fed back into the application.  This process strengthened my skills in backend development, debugging, and database design, and helped me overcome my initial insecurity with Java and large-scale coding projects.  


## Personal Development  
Beyond technical growth, this internship was also a big step in my personal development. I gained confidence in my coding skills, deepened my expertise in geospatial data, and experienced what it’s like to work full-time in a professional, agile team environment.  


## Conclusion  
My time at Trafficon was a rewarding experience that expanded both my technical and personal skill sets. I now feel more certain about my career path in geoinformatics and sustainable mobility.  I can warmly recommend Trafficon to other students interested in geospatial technologies—especially if you value teamwork, an active lifestyle, and a supportive company culture.
