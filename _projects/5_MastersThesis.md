I am currently working on my Thesis: ‘Spatial patterns of socially sustainable mobility: expanding a set of indicators to further include social aspects’, which deals with indicator design, data choice and comparing the spatial patterns occuring when calculating indicators for sustainable mobility in Austrian municipalities. Through this thesis i could enhance my knowledge on sustainable transport and related data, as well as the statistical methods to compare and evaluate the metrics chosen.

You can find more on my thesis here, once it is completed!
