Welcometo my portfolio! I am currently completing my Masters in Applied geoinformatics in Salzburg, where I learned about geo-data acquisition, processing and several analysis methods. I also learned about spatial simulation and analysis methods.

Through my work as a study assistant at the universities' Mobility Lab  and my current occupation at the mobility service provider [Trafficon]("https://www.trafficon.eu/geoservices"), my current focus centers Mobility research and deepening my software engineering knowledge.

### My Master's Thesis
I am currently working on my Thesis: 'Spatial patterns of socially sustainable mobility: expanding a set of indicators to further include social aspects', which deals with indicator design, data choice and comparing the spatial patterns occuring when calculating indicators for sustainable mobility in Austrian municipalities. Through this thesis i could enhance my knowledge on sustainable transport and related data, as well as the statistical methods to compare and evaluate the metrics chosen.

### What You will find here
This Portfolio page documents my achievements and projects I completed during the Masters program, showcasing my academic journey thus far. 

Thank you for visiting my site - I invite you to explore my work and to look at the projects I completed.
